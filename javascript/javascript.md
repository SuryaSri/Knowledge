__What is Javascript?__ JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code). So it is a language for the *Web*, it can update and change both *HTML* and *CSS* and can calculate, manipulate and validate the data. It can be used within any browser in the world. On top of that, it can be used to write server-side code using `node.js`.

__Usage :__ Either we can write the code in `.js` files and use node.js to run the code using the command - `node filename.js`. Otherwise we can write in node shell, to access the shell use the command - `node`.

__Version :__ `node v10.19.0`
