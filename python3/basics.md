# Python Basics
Welcome to the basics of Python Programming.

* Variables and Types

## Hello, World!
Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. The simplest directive in Python is the `print` directive - it simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C).

To print a String, just write:
```
print("hello, world!!!")
```

## Indentation
Python uses indentation for blocks, instead of curly braces. Both tabs and spaces are supported, but standard indentation requires four spaces. For example:
```
if True:
    print("True")
```

## Variables and Types
As python is object oriented and not statically typed, you do not need to declare variables, or declare their type before using them. *Every variable in Python is an object.* Now let us cover the basic types of variables.

### Numbers
### Strings
